# Programing-Scripting-problems
Programming &amp; Scripting module exercises

This repository includes the weekly tasks and attemps I made in order to solve these. 
I have added comments in parts of the code that might be confusing to understand only with code plus the general behavior we are expecting
from every program. 
Every weekly task/problem is named with the suggested name advised by the lecturer in every task description. 

#Program's list:
1. BMI.py
2.SecondString.py
3.Collatz.py
4.WeekDay.py
5.Squareroot.py
6.Es.py
